The exact savings depend on your current roof features, the upgrades performed, your insurance carrier, and your coverage amounts. Older homes that add Secondary Water Resistance (SWR) and improve roof-to-wall connections often see the most significant discounts."},{question:"What is Secondary Water Resistance (SWR)?",answer:"Secondary Water Resistance (SWR) is a self-adhered underlayment layer installed beneath your roof covering. It provides an additional waterproof barrier that helps prevent water intrusion during hurricanes when shingles or tiles may be damaged or blown off. SWR is one of the most valuable wind mitigation credits and is often required by modern Florida Building Code in high-wind zones."},{question:"Do I need a new roof to get wind mitigation credits?",answer:"Not always. Some wind mitigation upgrades can be added to an existing roof without full replacement, such as adding SWR during a partial re-roof, upgrading attic strap connections, or improving roof deck attachment in accessible areas. However, a full roof replacement provides the best opportunity to maximize all wind mitigation features at once. We can evaluate your current roof and recommend the most cost-effective approach."},{question:"How long does the wind mitigation process take?",answer:"The timeline varies by project scope. A full roof replacement with wind mitigation upgrades typically takes 3–7 days for residential homes, plus permit processing time. After completion, the wind mitigation inspection can usually be scheduled within 1–2 weeks. Most homeowners see their insurance credits applied within 30–60 days after submitting the updated Form 1802 to their insurance carrier."},{question:"What is a wind mitigation inspection (Form 1802)?",answer:'Form 1802 (officially the "Uniform Mitigation Verification Inspection Form") is a standardized report completed by a licensed inspector that documents specific wind-resistant features of your home. Insurance companies use this form to determine eligibility for wind mitigation discounts. The inspection covers roof shape, roof covering, roof deck attachment, roof-to-wall connections, secondary water resistance, and opening protections.'},{question:"Do you work with both homes and HOAs/condos?",answer:"Yes, All Phase Construction USA handles wind mitigation projects for single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums, and HOA/association buildings throughout Broward and Palm Beach Counties. We have extensive experience coordinating large-scale projects that require board approvals, multiple building permits, and phased construction schedules."},{question:"Will wind mitigation upgrades pay for themselves?",answer:"In most cases, yes. With annual insurance savings ranging from $500–$6,500, many homeowners recover the cost of wind mitigation upgrades within 3–7 years through reduced premiums alone. Beyond the financial benefits, these upgrades also provide better protection against storm damage, potentially preventing costly repairs, and often increase home resale value in Florida's hurricane-prone market."}],o=[{icon:x,title:"Secondary Water Resistance (SWR)",description:"Self-adhered underlayment that provides a waterproof barrier beneath your roof covering, preventing water intrusion during hurricanes.",benefit:"One of the highest-value wind mitigation credits"},{icon:g,title:"Roof-to-Wall Connections",description:"Hurricane straps, clips, or wraps that secure your roof structure to the walls, preventing roof lift-off during high winds.",benefit:"Critical for HVHZ compliance and insurance discounts"},{icon:f,title:"Roof Deck Attachment",description:"Proper nailing patterns and spacing for roof sheathing that meets or exceeds current Florida Building Code requirements.",benefit:"Strengthens overall roof system integrity"},{icon:w,title:"Roof Covering Upgrades",description:"Impact-resistant shingles, foam-adhered tile, or mechanically-seamed metal systems rated for high-velocity hurricane zones.",benefit:"Maximum wind resistance and insurance credits"}],d=[{number:1,title:"Free Roof & Attic Evaluation",description:"We inspect your roof covering, attic structure, and existing wind mitigation features to identify opportunities for improvement."},{number:2,title:"Identify Missing Features",description:"Our team documents current deficiencies and code-required upgrades, then explains which features will provide the best insurance credits."},{number:3,title:"Scope of Work & Pricing",description:"We provide a detailed proposal showing the upgrades, materials, timeline, and transparent pricing for your project."},{number:4,title:"Complete Upgrades",description:"Our licensed crews install all wind mitigation features according to Florida Building Code, with thorough documentation photos throughout."},{number:5,title:"Coordinate Inspection",description:"We help schedule a licensed wind mitigation inspector to complete your Form 1802 report with all new upgrades documented."},{number:6,title:"Submit to Insurance",description:"You provide the updated 1802 report to your insurance agent, who processes your wind mitigation credits and reduces your premiums."}],l=[{name:"Schedule Wind Mitigation Assessment",text:"Contact All Phase Construction USA for a free wind mitigation consultation.
