    {
      question: 'How much can I save with wind mitigation?',
      answer: 'Many South Florida homeowners save $500–$6,500 per year on homeowners insurance with proper wind mitigation upgrades and documentation. The exact savings depend on your current roof features, the upgrades performed, your insurance carrier, and your coverage amounts. Older homes that add Secondary Water Resistance (SWR) and improve roof-to-wall connections often see the most significant discounts.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is Secondary Water Resistance (SWR)?',
      answer: 'Secondary Water Resistance (SWR) is a self-adhered underlayment layer installed beneath your roof covering. It provides an additional waterproof barrier that helps prevent water intrusion during hurricanes when shingles or tiles may be damaged or blown off. SWR is one of the most valuable wind mitigation credits and is often required by modern Florida Building Code in high-wind zones.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need a new roof to get wind mitigation credits?',
      answer: 'Not always. Some wind mitigation upgrades can be added to an existing roof without full replacement, such as adding SWR during a partial re-roof, upgrading attic strap connections, or improving roof deck attachment in accessible areas. However, a full roof replacement provides the best opportunity to maximize all wind mitigation features at once. We can evaluate your current roof and recommend the most cost-effective approach.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does the wind mitigation process take?',
      answer: 'The timeline varies by project scope. A full roof replacement with wind mitigation upgrades typically takes 3–7 days for residential homes, plus permit processing time. After completion, the wind mitigation inspection can usually be scheduled within 1–2 weeks. Most homeowners see their insurance credits applied within 30–60 days after submitting the updated Form 1802 to their insurance carrier.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is a wind mitigation inspection (Form 1802)?',
      answer: 'Form 1802 (officially the "Uniform Mitigation Verification Inspection Form") is a standardized report completed by a licensed inspector that documents specific wind-resistant features of your home. Insurance companies use this form to determine eligibility for wind mitigation discounts. The inspection covers roof shape, roof covering, roof deck attachment, roof-to-wall connections, secondary water resistance, and opening protections.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you work with both homes and HOAs/condos?',
      answer: 'Yes, All Phase Construction USA handles wind mitigation projects for single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums, and HOA/association buildings throughout Broward and Palm Beach Counties. We have extensive experience coordinating large-scale projects that require board approvals, multiple building permits, and phased construction schedules.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will wind mitigation upgrades pay for themselves?',
      answer: 'In most cases, yes. With annual insurance savings ranging from $500–$6,500, many homeowners recover the cost of wind mitigation upgrades within 3–7 years through reduced premiums alone. Beyond the financial benefits, these upgrades also provide better protection against storm damage, potentially preventing costly repairs, and often increase home resale value in Florida\'s hurricane-prone market.',

              <p>
                Wind mitigation refers to structural improvements that strengthen your roof and home to
                withstand high winds and hurricanes. These upgrades protect your property during severe
                weather and demonstrate to insurance companies that your home is less risky to insure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Florida insurance carriers offer substantial discounts when specific wind-resistant features
                are present and properly documented on Form 1802 (the official wind mitigation inspection
                report). Features like Secondary Water Resistance (SWR), enhanced roof-to-wall connections,
                improved roof deck attachment, and impact-resistant roof coverings can each contribute to
                your overall savings.
              </p>
              <p>
                For many homeowners, wind mitigation upgrades pay for themselves within 3–7 years through
                reduced insurance premiums alone—while also providing better protection and increasing home
                resale value in Florida's hurricane-prone coastal markets.
