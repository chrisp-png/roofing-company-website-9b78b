      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Architectural vs 3-Tab Shingles</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        When most homeowners think of "shingle roofing," they're thinking of asphalt-based roofing products. However, there are significant differences in quality, performance, and lifespan between basic 3-tab shingles and modern architectural shingles.
      </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Why We Prefer Architectural Shingles</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            All Phase Construction USA primarily installs architectural shingles (also called dimensional or laminate shingles) rather than basic 3-tab shingles. Here's why:
          </p>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-neutral-300">
            <li class="flex items-start">
              <span class="text-red-500 mr-2">•</span>
              <span><strong>Superior Wind Resistance:</strong> Architectural shingles are heavier, thicker, and more wind-resistant than 3-tab shingles. When installed to HVHZ standards, they can meet wind ratings of 110–130 mph or higher.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="flex items-start">
              <span class="text-red-500 mr-2">•</span>
              <span><strong>Longer Lifespan:</strong> Architectural shingles typically last 25–30 years in South Florida, compared to 15–20 years for 3-tab shingles.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="flex items-start">
              <span class="text-red-500 mr-2">•</span>
              <span><strong>Better Appearance:</strong> Architectural shingles have a dimensional, textured look that enhances curb appeal and mimics the appearance of more expensive roofing materials.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="flex items-start">
              <span class="text-red-500 mr-2">•</span>
              <span><strong>Improved Warranty Coverage:</strong> Most architectural shingles come with stronger manufacturer warranties, including coverage for wind damage and premature failure.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="flex items-start">
              <span class="text-red-500 mr-2">•</span>
              <span><strong>Better Value:</strong> While the initial cost is slightly higher than 3-tab, the improved lifespan and performance make architectural shingles a better long-term investment.</span>
            </li>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">When 3-Tab Shingles Make Sense</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            There are limited situations where 3-tab shingles may be appropriate — typically on rental properties, budget-constrained projects, or temporary structures where short-term cost savings outweigh long-term performance. However, for primary residences and properties in HVHZ areas, we strongly recommend architectural shingles or better.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4">HVHZ Nailing & Underlayment Upgrades</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        In South Florida's High Velocity Hurricane Zone, it's not enough to simply nail shingles to the roof. HVHZ building codes require specific fastening patterns, underlayment systems, and installation methods designed to withstand extreme wind events. Here's what separates a code-compliant HVHZ shingle roof from a basic installation:
      </p>

      <div class="space-y-4 mb-6">
        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Enhanced Fastening Schedules</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            HVHZ installations require 6 nails per shingle (compared to 4 nails in standard installations) with specific placement to maximize wind resistance. All fasteners must be corrosion-resistant and driven to proper depth — not too shallow (which reduces holding power) and not too deep (which can tear the shingle).
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            All Phase Construction USA follows manufacturer fastening diagrams and HVHZ standards on every shingle roof we install. This is non-negotiable and critical for warranty coverage and code compliance.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">High-Performance Synthetic Underlayment</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Old-school felt paper is no longer acceptable for HVHZ installations. Modern synthetic underlayments are stronger, lighter, more water-resistant, and far more UV-stable than traditional felt. They won't tear during installation, won't absorb moisture, and provide superior backup waterproofing if shingles are damaged or displaced during a storm.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            We install premium synthetic underlayment on every shingle roof as part of our Good, Better, and Best packages. Our Premium tier includes upgraded underlayment systems with enhanced water and heat resistance.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Secondary Water Resistance (SWR)</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Florida Building Code requires secondary water resistance in critical areas including valleys, eaves, and around penetrations. We install self-adhering membranes in these locations to create a waterproof barrier that protects your home even if shingles fail during extreme weather.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            This upgrade is not optional — it's required by code and essential for wind-mitigation credits that can reduce your insurance premiums by 20–45%.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Starter Strips & Edge Sealing</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            Proper starter strip installation along eaves and rakes is critical for wind resistance. We use continuous starter strips with enhanced sealant to ensure the first course of shingles is fully bonded and cannot be lifted by wind-driven uplift forces.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Roof Deck Re-Nailing (When Required)</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            If your existing roof deck does not meet current attachment standards, we can re-nail or re-screw the sheathing to the roof framing as part of the replacement project. This is a common wind-mitigation upgrade that improves structural performance and qualifies for insurance discounts.
