      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Flat Roof Challenges in South Florida</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Flat and low-slope roofs face unique challenges in South Florida's hot, humid, and storm-prone environment. Unlike steep-slope roofs that shed water quickly through gravity, flat roofs must rely on properly designed drainage systems, high-performance membranes, and precise installation to prevent leaks and premature failure.
      </p>

      <div class="space-y-3 mb-6">
        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Ponding Water</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            Flat roofs are rarely perfectly flat — and they shouldn't be. Areas where water pools for more than 48 hours after rainfall (called "ponding") accelerate membrane degradation, promote algae growth, and increase the risk of leaks. Proper slope design, tapered insulation systems, and strategic drain placement are essential to prevent ponding.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">UV Exposure & Heat</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            South Florida's intense UV radiation and surface temperatures exceeding 160°F during summer months cause rapid degradation of roofing membranes and sealants. Only UV-resistant, heat-reflective systems designed for extreme climates should be used.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Wind Uplift</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            Flat roofs are especially vulnerable to wind uplift during hurricanes. HVHZ-compliant installations require mechanically fastened or fully adhered systems with engineered attachment schedules that resist extreme wind forces.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Drainage Design</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            Clogged drains, inadequate overflow provisions, and poor slope design are common causes of flat roof failure. Building codes require primary drains, secondary overflow drains, and emergency scuppers to prevent catastrophic water accumulation during heavy rainfall.
          </p>
        </div>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Systems We Install</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        We install a range of flat and low-slope roofing systems, each suited to different applications, budgets, and performance requirements:
      </p>

      <div class="space-y-4 mb-6">
        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefin)</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            TPO is one of the most popular flat roofing systems in commercial and multi-family applications. This single-ply membrane is heat-welded at the seams to create a watertight, monolithic surface.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            <strong>Advantages:</strong> Excellent UV resistance, highly reflective white surface reduces cooling costs, strong seam strength from heat welding, good puncture resistance, and cost-effective compared to PVC or multi-layer systems.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            <strong>Best For:</strong> Condo buildings, small commercial properties, and budget-conscious projects where energy efficiency and long-term performance are priorities.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Expected Lifespan:</strong> 15–25 years with proper maintenance, depending on membrane thickness and installation quality.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride)</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            PVC is a premium single-ply membrane offering superior chemical resistance, fire performance, and longevity compared to TPO. Like TPO, seams are heat-welded for maximum strength.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            <strong>Advantages:</strong> Exceptional chemical resistance (important for roofs near kitchen exhaust or industrial equipment), superior flexibility in cold weather (though less relevant in South Florida), excellent fire resistance, and longer lifespan than TPO.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            <strong>Best For:</strong> High-end commercial buildings, restaurants and buildings with grease-laden exhaust, and properties where long-term performance justifies higher initial investment.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Expected Lifespan:</strong> 20–30 years with proper maintenance, making it one of the longest-lasting single-ply systems available.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Modified Bitumen (Mod Bit)</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Modified bitumen is a multi-layer asphalt-based system that combines the waterproofing properties of traditional built-up roofing with modern polymer technology. Layers are typically torch-applied or cold-adhered.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            <strong>Advantages:</strong> Excellent puncture resistance, self-healing properties when minor damage occurs, proven performance in South Florida's climate, and easier to repair than single-ply membranes.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            <strong>Best For:</strong> Smaller commercial buildings, internal gutters, areas prone to foot traffic or mechanical equipment placement, and properties where repairability is a priority.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Expected Lifespan:</strong> 15–20 years depending on number of plies, surface coatings, and maintenance.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Hybrid & Multi-Layer Systems</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            For complex roofs or high-performance applications, we install hybrid systems combining different materials — for example, modified bitumen base layers with TPO or PVC cap sheets, or multi-ply built-up systems with reflective coatings.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Best For:</strong> Properties requiring maximum redundancy, roofs with unusual geometric challenges, or buildings where extended warranties and enhanced performance justify the investment.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Insulation & Tapered Systems</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        One of the most important — and often overlooked — aspects of flat roofing is the insulation and slope design beneath the membrane. Proper insulation not only improves energy efficiency but also plays a critical role in drainage and long-term roof performance.
      </p>

      <div class="space-y-4 mb-6">
        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Tapered Insulation Systems</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Tapered insulation systems use pre-cut insulation boards of varying thickness to create positive drainage toward roof drains, eliminating ponding water. This is one of the most effective ways to extend flat roof lifespan and prevent premature membrane failure.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            All Phase Construction USA designs custom tapered systems for properties with drainage problems or where maximum longevity is desired. While this adds to the initial investment, the payback in reduced maintenance and extended roof life is substantial.
          </p>

        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Energy Efficiency & R-Value Upgrades</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Florida Energy Code requires minimum R-values for commercial roofing systems. Upgrading insulation beyond code minimums reduces cooling loads, lowers utility bills, and improves occupant comfort — especially important for top-floor condos and commercial spaces.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            We install polyisocyanurate (polyiso) and expanded polystyrene (EPS) insulation systems with R-values tailored to your building's needs and budget.

        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Roof Deck Cover Boards</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            Cover boards installed over insulation provide additional puncture resistance, protect insulation from foot traffic and mechanical damage, and create a stable surface for membrane installation. This upgrade is especially valuable for roofs with HVAC equipment or frequent maintenance access.

          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            When flat roofs show signs of aging but don't yet require full replacement, elastomeric or acrylic roof coatings can restore waterproofing, improve reflectivity, and extend service life by 5–10 years.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            Coatings are especially effective on modified bitumen systems where the cap sheet has weathered but the underlying layers remain sound. This approach can be a cost-effective bridge to full replacement while maintaining weather protection.
