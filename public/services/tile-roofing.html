      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Concrete vs Clay / Composite Tile</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Tile roofing is one of the most popular choices in South Florida, prized for its durability, energy efficiency, and timeless Mediterranean appearance. However, not all tile roofs are created equal. Understanding the differences between concrete, clay, and composite tile systems is essential for making an informed decision.
      </p>

      <div class="space-y-4 mb-6">
        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Concrete Tile Roofing</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Concrete tile is the most common tile roofing material in South Florida. Made from sand, cement, and pigments, concrete tiles are durable, cost-effective, and available in a wide range of colors and profiles.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            <strong>Advantages:</strong> Lower initial cost compared to clay, excellent wind resistance when properly installed, good thermal performance, and long lifespan (30–50 years with proper maintenance).
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Considerations:</strong> Concrete tiles are porous and can absorb moisture, leading to algae growth, color fading, and eventual surface degradation if not maintained. They are also heavier than other roofing materials, requiring proper structural support.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Clay Tile Roofing (Premium Option)</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Clay tile is the premium choice for South Florida homeowners seeking the highest level of durability, color retention, and authentic Mediterranean styling. Made from natural clay fired at high temperatures, these tiles are denser, harder, and more resistant to moisture absorption than concrete.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            <strong>Advantages:</strong> Superior longevity (50–100 years), excellent color retention, minimal maintenance, non-porous surface resists algae and mold, and timeless aesthetic appeal that enhances property value.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Considerations:</strong> Higher initial cost compared to concrete tile. However, when lifecycle costs, maintenance, and resale value are considered, clay tile often proves to be the most cost-effective choice for long-term property ownership.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Composite & Synthetic Tile (Premium Alternative)</h3>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            High-end composite tile systems use advanced polymer technology to replicate the appearance of clay or slate while offering lighter weight and improved impact resistance. These systems are ideal for properties requiring the look of clay tile without the structural load.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Advantages:</strong> Significantly lighter than concrete or clay, excellent wind and impact resistance, Class A fire rating, minimal maintenance, and often come with enhanced warranties.

        When using our <a href="/roof-cost-calculator.html" class="text-red-500 hover:text-red-400">Roof Cost Calculator</a>, the "Good" and "Better" tiers typically refer to concrete tile systems with varying levels of underlayment and accessory upgrades. The "Best" and "Premium" tiers include higher-end profiles, upgraded waterproofing, and options like clay or composite tile systems.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Underlayment & Flashing Matter More Than the Tile</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Here's what most homeowners and property managers don't realize: <strong>in South Florida, tile roofs almost never fail because the tiles themselves break or wear out.</strong> They fail because water gets underneath the tiles due to poor underlayment, improper flashing details, or inadequate valley and penetration waterproofing.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Tile is simply the decorative and protective top layer. The real waterproofing system lies beneath — and that's where All Phase Construction USA focuses our attention and expertise.

            <span class="text-red-500 mr-2">•</span>

          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            We carefully remove existing tiles and underlayment, then thoroughly inspect the roof deck for rot, water damage, or structural issues. Any damaged sheathing is repaired or replaced before proceeding.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-neutral-900/50 rounded-xl p-4">

          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            If required by HVHZ code or inspection findings, we re-nail or re-screw the deck to ensure proper attachment to roof framing. This step is critical for wind resistance and often required for insurance and permitting.

            We install premium synthetic underlayment across the entire roof deck, with secondary water barriers in valleys, eaves, and critical areas. This creates a complete waterproof membrane beneath the tile.
