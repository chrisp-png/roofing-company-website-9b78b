      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4">When Is Full Roof Replacement Needed?</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Most South Florida roofs require replacement every 15–30 years depending on the material, installation quality, and exposure to weather. Common reasons homeowners and property managers choose full roof replacement include:
      </p>
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-neutral-300 mb-4">
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="text-red-500 mr-2">•</span>
          <span><strong>Age:</strong> Roofs nearing the end of their rated lifespan often show wear across the entire system, making replacement more cost-effective than ongoing repairs.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="text-red-500 mr-2">•</span>
          <span><strong>Hurricane Damage:</strong> After major storms, widespread damage to shingles, tiles, or underlayment may require a complete tear-off and reinstallation.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="text-red-500 mr-2">•</span>
          <span><strong>Chronic Leaks:</strong> When repairs no longer stop water intrusion, the deck, underlayment, or substrate may be compromised beyond spot fixes.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="text-red-500 mr-2">•</span>
          <span><strong>Insurance Requirements:</strong> Many carriers now require roofs over a certain age to be replaced before issuing or renewing coverage in Florida.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="text-red-500 mr-2">•</span>
          <span><strong>HOA or Real Estate Requirements:</strong> Associations may mandate replacement before resale, or lenders may require updated roofs for financing approval.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        If you're unsure whether your roof needs replacement or if targeted repairs will suffice, our team provides honest on-site assessments with photo documentation and cost comparisons.
