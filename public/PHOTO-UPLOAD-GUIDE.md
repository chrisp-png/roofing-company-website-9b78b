## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I don't have a photo that matches this description"
Use your closest match. If you have multiple similar photos, choose the best quality one. You can always swap photos later.

### "Can I use the same photo for multiple filenames?"
While not ideal, you can temporarily use the same photo for similar categories (e.g., use one aerial tile photo for both aerial-1 and aerial-2). Replace with unique photos when available.

### "What if my photo is vertical/portrait orientation?"
The website gallery is optimized for landscape (horizontal) photos. Portrait photos will be cropped. Try to use landscape orientation when possible.

### "My file sizes are too large"
Use an image compression tool:
- **Online:** tinyjpg.com or squoosh.app
- **Mac:** ImageOptim (free app)
- **Windows:** FileOptimizer (free app)
- **Target:** 200-500KB per image

### "What resolution should I use?"
- **Minimum:** 1200px wide
- **Recommended:** 1600px wide
- **Maximum:** 2400px wide
The system will automatically handle responsive sizing.
